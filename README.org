* Arkanoid by elnawe :ATTACH:

Just another clone of Arkanoid done with C and SDL2 by only reading the SDL2
official Wiki: https://wiki.libsdl.org/.

This is shitty code, I did it in just a couple of hours and because I was
bored and needed to get back to game programming. Everything is in just one
file and there are a couple of bugs that makes the game more hilarious.

Also with great Tetris music in the background!

Feel free to clone this repo and do whatever.
